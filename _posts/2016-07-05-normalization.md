Normalization is a processing technique used in spectral analysis. Its primary purpose is in eliminating systematic variation between spectra. It can be implemented easily through Vespucci.

First, the desired dataset should be imported. Frequently, spectral data is baseline-corrected before normalization. After these steps, simply click the Processing tab and select Normalize/Standardize.

Next, the desired form of normalization should be selected. A short description of each method is below.

This should then cause all spectra to be normalized, as seen below.

### Normalization Methods ###

Vespucci supports 9 types of normalization: Min/Max, Unit Length, Unit Area, Z-score, Standard Normal Variate, Peak Intensity, Scale Spectra, Absolute Value, and Mean Center.

*Min/Max*

*Unit Length*

*Unit Area*

*Z-score*

*Standard Normal Variate*

*Peak Intensity*

*Scale Spectra*

*Absolute Value*

*Mean Center*
